# Firebase React Semantic UI Site Template
### Welcome
Nice to have you as a visitor! 

To view this as a live demo, head on over to [semantic-ui.milesbd.ca](https://semantic-ui.milesbd.ca).

This site was created using Firebase as a back-end for authentication, user db, cloud functions, and hosting. O the front-end, React, along with [Semantic UI for React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) (one of my favourite component libraries).

### Purpose

This template site is intended to give a taste of my work, and what I can help you accomplish. While the features may not be evident at first glance, the site offers:

 - Multi-lingual support
 - Role-based page access (i.e. admin, staff, consumer)
 - Social Login/Account Creation
 - Admin Panel for user management
 - Mobile-Responsive design
 - Dark Mode 

With this core functionality, much more functionality can be added to suit your unique needs and accomplish your goals.

Like what you see? Please get in touch, and I'd be happy to chat about how this template can help you with your next project!

### Resources Used

This template would not have been possible without the great course offered by Robin Wieruch, [The Road to Firebase](https://courses.robinwieruch.de/). I highly encourage anyone looking to get started with Firebase & React to check out his courses

The component library [Semantic UI for React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) provides the awesome design you see. A great UI library, that offers a fantastic developer experience.
